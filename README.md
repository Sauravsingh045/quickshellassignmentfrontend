Kanban Board Application Overview This React JS application is designed to provide an interactive Kanban board experience, leveraging the Quicksell API available at https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment. The Kanban board allows users to manage and organize tickets dynamically based on different grouping and sorting options.

Features

Dynamic Grouping Users can utilize the "display" button to choose from three distinct ways to group the data:
By Status: Group tickets based on their current status. By User: Arrange tickets according to the assigned user. By Priority: Group tickets based on their priority level. 2. Sorting Options In addition to grouping, users have the flexibility to sort the displayed tickets in two ways:

Priority: Arrange tickets in descending order of priority. Title: Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.

Usage Open the application in your browser.

Click the "display" button to reveal the grouping options.

Select a grouping option (Status, User, Priority).

The Kanban board will dynamically adjust to reflect the chosen grouping.

Use the sorting options (Priority, Title) to further organize the displayed tickets.
